File Downloader:

Build an application that downloads files from a given URL.
csharp
Copy code
static async Task Main()
{
    string url = "https://example.com/samplefile.txt";
    string destinationPath = "downloadedfile.txt";

    using (HttpClient client = new HttpClient())
    {
        HttpResponseMessage response = await client.GetAsync(url);
        byte[] bytes = await response.Content.ReadAsByteArrayAsync();
        await File.WriteAllBytesAsync(destinationPath, bytes);
    }

    Console.WriteLine("File downloaded successfully!");
}
